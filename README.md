#  VoxelBrush
3D Drawing AR experience with close range multi user support

### Getting Started
Open VoxelBrush.xcworkspace, build and run.

### Prerequisites
XCode 11.0
iOS 13.0
More than one device for multi user functionality

### Usage
To sync with another device, find a fine-featured environment and wait until the green sync button appears and press it once. The second device's AR session would reinitialize. Now you can try drawing in a shared AR environment.
To store your work, press Save button in the bottom right. Load previously saved with the left top Folder button.
In the saved models view there is also an upload button, which you can use to upload an asset to the S3 server and get the link to the clipboard.
